# Aa

> A reactive web framework inspired by Armeria.

**Aa** is a reactive web framework that allows you to build APIs in the style of [Armeria](https://armeria.dev/).

It is fully reactive and designed for research purposes.

Please note that it lacks many of the features provided by typical web frameworks.

Refer to the [examples](https://github.com/icepeppermint/aa/tree/main/examples) directory for usage instructions.

**Most importantly, this framework is not intended for production use.**
